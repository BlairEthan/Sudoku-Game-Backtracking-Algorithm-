(Backtracking-Algorithm)</br></h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Backtracking is a type of algorithm that solves contrained solution problems by abandoning solutions as soon as it determines that the integer can not possible be completed to the solution.In this case it was implemented to solve a soduku game.

<h3><br><b> Algorithm: </b></br></h3>
<b><i> Find a vacant area on the board</b></i>
<br> 1. Try to fill in the numbers 1 through 9 there. <br>
<br> 2. Using the present board, determine whether the digit is correct in the current position. <br>
<br> 3. Recursively try to fill the board using steps 1-3 if the digit is valid. <br>
<br> 4. Reset the square you just filled and return to the first step if it is invalid. <br>
<br> 5. We have a solution once the board is complete, as defined by this algorithm. <br>
